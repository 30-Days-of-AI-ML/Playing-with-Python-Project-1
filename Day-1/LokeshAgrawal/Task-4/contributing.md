In the task-4, we have to convert the temperature from celcius to fahrenheit or vice-versa.
In the task4.py, I have written my code --->

The all the steps of the code written in task4.py is given below --->

1) First of all we define two function. First will be of calculating temperature from celcius to fahrenheit and another one will be of calculating temperature from 
   fahrenheit to celcius. And the two function returns the temperature in the corresponding unit

2) Now we create a another function(name user_interaction) which will interact with the user and do some conditional computations.
3) In this function, we take the user choice as what he/she want to convert from c to f or f to c.
4) Then we take input the temperature.
5) Then print the output.

Aditional steps --->
1) We ask user to again using the temperature or quit the calculator.
2) for this we take input from the user and as per the choice, our program do the respective command.
