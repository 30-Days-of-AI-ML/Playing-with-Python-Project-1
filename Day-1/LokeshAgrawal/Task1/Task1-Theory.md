In our task-1, we solve the integrals using the sympy module of python. Sympy module of python help us to differential and integral calculus in term of programs.
Following steps demonstrate our task3.py --->
1) First of all, we input the sympy module of sympy as sp.
2) Then write the forms(x**2, x*log(x) ...)
3) Now using sp.integrate, we integrate the forms and simply print the statements.
