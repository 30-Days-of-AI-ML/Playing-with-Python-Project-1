All the steps we have written code in Task3.py are --->

1) We first define two function. One will be of calculating multiples of a number and other will be of interacting with the user.
2) The first function(named muliples(num)) takes num as the input to calculate the multiples of the number(here num).
3) Then in the other function(named user_interact), we have taken input from the user and called the multiples function to compute the multiples of the number.

Additional Steps --->
1) Here, we ask the user to again finding the multiples or quit this calculator.
2) We take user_choice as input from the user.
4) And as per the choice our program do the respective computation.
